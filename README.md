**Inspiration**

Team Cypher witnessed the struggles of children in their community who lacked access to educational resources due to financial constraints. Inspired to make a difference, they embarked on creating Jengo, a free online platform offering equal learning opportunities for all.

**What it Does**

Jengo acts as a lifeline for underprivileged children, providing free, online education accessible from anywhere with an internet connection. It tackles financial barriers by offering:

* Engaging video lessons
* Interactive quizzes
* Downloadable materials

Aligned with the local curriculum, Jengo supplements schoolwork while keeping students motivated through interactive features. Jengo goes beyond academics by offering:

* Life skills modules
* Potential mentor connections

This empowers students with the knowledge and tools needed to thrive.

**How We Built It**

Jengo utilizes a powerful tech stack:

* **Next.js (React-based framework):** Provides a robust foundation for a dynamic and user-friendly web application.
* **MongoDB (NoSQL database):** Enables easy scaling and adaptation as the user base grows.
* **Vercel (hosting platform):** Ensures Jengo's constant availability and smooth performance.
* **Custom domain name (GoDaddy):** Solidifies Jengo's unique online presence.

**Challenges Overcome**

Building Jengo wasn't without hurdles. Securing resources like website hosting proved challenging at times. The team encountered technical issues with the backend and website dynamism, including video upload difficulties. However, perseverance led them to overcome these obstacles.

**Accomplishments**

Despite the challenges, Jengo has become a beacon of opportunity:

* **Free Education:** Creates a platform accessible to all.
* **Engaging Content:** Keeps students motivated and reinforces learning.
* **Empowerment:** Provides children with the knowledge and skills to succeed.

**What We Learned**

Teamwork was paramount in Jengo's creation. They divided tasks, supported each other through problems, and discovered the vast need for such resources globally. Witnessing the limited opportunities for underprivileged children in Africa fueled their determination to not only complete Jengo but continue its development beyond the hackathon.
